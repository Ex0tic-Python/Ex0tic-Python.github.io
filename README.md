# ex0tic-python.github.io
This repository serves as a way of hosting my website on Github Pages which can be found at https://ex0tic-python.github.io/  
The web page is a small passion project I want to update to learn about front-end development and to just have something to do. 
If you find any spelling errors or mistakes, feel free to open an issue or pull request and I'll take a look at it. And reccomendations or ideas are also welcome.
