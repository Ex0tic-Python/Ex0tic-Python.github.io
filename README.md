# ex0tic-python.github.io
This repository serves as a way of hosting my website on Github Pages which can be found at https://ex0tic-python.github.io/  
The web page is written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript as that is all Github Page's supports. I update it rather frequently and always try and make it better whenever I for whatever reason get an urge to.  
If you find any spelling errors or mistakes, feel free to open an issue or pull request and I'll take a look at it.

TODO:
Add button click effects
Update list CSS
Fix up the main page's JS  a bit more
Fix the other sites and add the new features
Possibly fix for phone
