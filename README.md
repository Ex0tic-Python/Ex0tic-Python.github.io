# ex0tic-python.github.io
This repository serves as a backup website should my main page (https://ex0ticpython.000webhostapp.com/) ever go down.  
This version of my web page will be written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript as that is all Github Page's supports, unlike my main website which utilizes PHP for whatever wacky thing I use it for.  
As a result, the web pages are most likely not a 1:1 replica because the other page allows dynamic pages.
