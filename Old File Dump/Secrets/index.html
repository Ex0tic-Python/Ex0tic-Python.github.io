        <p>Well, well, you figured out the secret. Chances are I told you how to do it. If I didn't, well then you probably looked through the JS for this page and found out the code. Or maybe you just used the console to delete the cover. Who knows. If only I could add server-side code (PHP). Regardless, you made it this far, so congrats!</p>
        <p>I plan to add some more secrets here and there, but don't expect too many. Or maybe every page already has one? Find out yourself :)</p>
