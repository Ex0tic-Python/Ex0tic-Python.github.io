Free hosting for Static pages. So I just wrote the HTML and CSS (which you can see by pressing CTRL+U) and now we are here :)<br />I plan to maintain my website until I get bored, or forget about it. For now, I'll use it for my personal stuff, such as my services and what not.<br /><br />As I mentioned above, I am using Github to host the site. You can find the repo here:</p>
