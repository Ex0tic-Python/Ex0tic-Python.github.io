            <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
            <p>To start with, I wanted to say thanks for stopping by, It really means a lot to me.</p>
            <p>Anywas, a bit more info on the site:</p>
            <p>The reason I made this site is because I had nothing to do and it would be nice to make a site for myself using HTML and CSS which I never got to apply after learning, so its a nice refresher.</p>
            <p>Because I don't wanna pay every year for a site (even though it's like $7 a year which isn't anything at all), I decided to host it on Github pages. Free hosting for Static pages. So I just wrote the HTML and CSS (which you can see by pressing CTRL+U) and now we are here :)</p>
            <p>I plan to maintain my website until I get bored, or forget about it.</p>
            <p>For now, I'll use it for my personal stuff, such as my services and what not.</p>
