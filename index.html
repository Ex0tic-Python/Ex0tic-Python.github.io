            <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
            <p>I made this page as a way of not only expirementing with Web Dev and learning it, but also making something paractical I've always wanted to make. As a result, I'll constantly add new stuff and update this page to add any new features I like or think of. You can also find a lot of other stuff relating to me here so take a look around!</p>
            <p>Wondering how you can have a page of your own? Or maybe want just take a look at the (terrible) source code? Well, this page is hosted on Github Pages meaning I have a repository for it. The link to it is below:</p>
            <br>
            <a class="link_button" href="https://github.com/Ex0tic-Python/ex0tic-python.github.io" target="_blank">
                Github Repository
            </a>
            <br><br>
            <p>If you find a problem with the website, feel free to open a pull request or drop an issue in the repository and I'll take a look at it when I can. Anyways, just wanted to say thanks for stopping by and taking a look. I really appreciate it as this took a bit of effort to learn and debug. It's nice to have your hard work seen by anyone.</p>
