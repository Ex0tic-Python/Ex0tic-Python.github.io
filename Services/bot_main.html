            <p>If you are here, I probably sent you the link to this page because you contacted me on Discord for a free bot. Well, I'll quickly explain a few things, such as my terms and conditions, requests, and whatever else I put here. Oh and also:</p>
            <h3><b>PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE PAGE!!!</b></h3>
            <p>I want you to understand what I can or can't do so if your request is too much, you don't waste your time. Anyways, let's continue</p>
            <br />
            <h2>Yes, free as in <b><i>FREE</b></i></h2>
            <hr width=500 />
            <p>When I say free, I mean free as in you owe me nothing, ever. No strings attached. I don't even need you to credit me or anything. To clarify, you owe me nothing ever. I don't need payment, credit, nothing.</p>
            <br />
            <h2>Why for Free???</h2>
            <hr width=500 />
            <p>Well to be honest, there are 3 reasons:<br />1. I can't collect payments. I don't have a paypal, cashapp, etc. and honestly, don't feel like making one. Oh, and also, I can't even make one :d. I'm not of the legal age to make one.<br />2. I like to help people. While it's <i>technically</i> not help, I just like making others happy :)<br />3. And lastly, I just love programming! I love programming and do it for fun so I have no problem making stuff. And plus, the experince is nice :)</p>
            <br />
            <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
            <hr width=500 />
            <dl>
                <dt>Because my service is free, nothing is guaranteed</dt>
                <dd>While I will try my hardest to complete the bot and whatnot, I can't control what happens in my life much, so anything that may happen that messes with the bot isn't my fault. Please keep in mind I'm a human who also has stuff to do, whether it be school, or something else, I can't spend my full time working on something I don't recieve pay for. For example, if some event cause certain dates for me to be filled, such as an upcoming exam for which I have to study for, I may have to push the date I give the script for the bot. Another example I've had happen to me is burning my hand badly, resulting in me not being able to use a keyboard as easily as usual. Either way, I will ALWAYS try my hardest to complete any and all bots I recieve a request for.</dd>
                <dt>I choose deadlines for when it will be complete</dt>
                <dd>Please keep in mind that you are on my time. I also have stuff to do, similarly to how you don't have the time to program a bot yourself. Please bare with me.</dd>
                <dt>The request cannot be too complex</dt>
                <dd>Because this term has no clear line, I judge the requests myself and have the right to refuse any requests that I deem too hard or complex. While I try to avoid this, I simply do not take request for fully custom bots. One example I commonly share is that I don't make bots like MEE6 or YAGPDB. They are simply too complex and take time and effort to make. While I do put time and effort, the bots I make are simple bots that don't take much effort. For example, a bot with a simple currency system is an alright request.</dd>
                <dt> <!-- CONTINUE HERE                  -->
            </dl>
            
            <p>Anyways, that's about it. Now that you have read all of that, you may get back to me on Discord and we can continue.</p>
