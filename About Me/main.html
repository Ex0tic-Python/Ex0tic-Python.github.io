            <p>Hello World! My name is Anibal, AKA: Ex0tic_Python</p>
            <p>I'm a young programmer located in the US who programs for fun, mainly in Python (Hence where my name comes from!)</p>
            <p>I also enjoy many other things such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Playing video Games (Mainly FPS's)</li>
                <li>Playing the Violin</li>
                <li>Composing Music</>
                <li>Listening to music (Spotify at the bottom)</li>
                <li>And of course, Programming!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And that's just a few of the many things. I sadly can't list them all because this page would then be too long!<p>
            <p>I also want to say thanks for stopping by! It truly means a lot to me that you would even visit my Website, let alone explore it.</P>
            <br />
            <p>Well, that's about it. Thanks for stopping by :D</p>
